Open Infrastructure technology has become increasingly mature. However, the greatest software is useless if it cannot be operated confidently. For this to happen, skills and knowledge must be built up, fostered and retained. In an increasingly competitive market for skilled people and increasingly complex IT systems, this is becoming an ever-greater challenge for governments, institutions, and companies. How can we operate digital offerings in a self-determined, secure and qualitatively excellent manner?

The answer to this must be the collectivization of operational knowledge, just as it is being practiced for many years with software code. This manifesto provides the foundational principles and invites organizations to join this movement.

## We build a community of practice
From time to time, we can get mentally stuck and may need a sparring partner to think outside the box. Open Operations builds a community of practice to keep the barrier to entry low and create a thriving environment for comfortable exchange. Regardless of individual knowledge level, everyone contributes and enriches this community with their knowledge and individual views. Communities of practice connect through various channels serving both asynchronous and synchronous communication needs in the form of pair operating or on a larger scale to solve these challenges together. Therefore, we are building a network by encouraging organizations to foster and connect internal and external communities of practice.

## We share knowledge

## We believe that failures make us experts
We firmly believe that failures make us experts. The way we handle mistakes is how we become better. We think, that handling mistakes in an optimal way means to communicate about them openly and without shame. We are convinced that the culture we build around failures is fundamental for an innovative environment: Not being afraid of making mistakes opens the door to trying new things, without having the fear to fail. We encourage people to raise their voice - not only in case of success, but also in case of failure. We are sure, that this is one of the best ways to prevent others from making the same mistakes we did.

## We're transparent about our incidents

## We're transparent about our operational processes
We share our internal processes for the sake of transparency. We firmly believe that transparency leads to better and more reliable processes. We are convinced that publishing well-documented operational processes offers a great opportunity to gather feedback and inspiration from the wide public. 
 
Likewise, we are convinced that us sharing our operational experiences can be of inspiration and benefit for others. In today's business environment, most companies are facing the same challenges. By sharing knowledge the same way the open source community shares software, a common knowledge base can become a reality, allowing everybody to benefit. 
 
We aim to get away from being a big black box and become a source of shared knowledge. We consider the disclosure of internal processes as an essential step towards this direction.
