Open Infrastructure technology has become increasingly mature. However, the greatest software is useless if it cannot be operated confidently. For this to happen, skills and knowledge must be built up, fostered and retained. In an increasingly competitive market for skilled people and increasingly complex IT systems, this is becoming an ever-greater challenge for governments, institutions, and companies. How can we operate digital offerings in a self-determined, secure and qualitatively excellent manner?

While software as a means of production has been and is being increasingly collectivized thanks to the open source movement, organizations continue to protect operational knowledge like a holy grail. How sovereign can an organization act, if precisely this important knowledge only adds to the lottery factor? The answer to this must be the collectivization of operational knowledge, just as it is being practiced for many years with software code. So, we need to build communities who collaborate on exchanging and recording this experience and the tooling built to simplify the automation of operational processes. We create a climate in which operations is not supposed to never make any mistakes – instead we create infrastructure that is robust against mistakes and a culture where openly talking about mistakes – even beyond organizational boundaries – and learning from them is appreciated and considered a strength. We learn more from our mistakes than from our successes – usually because we analyze them much more intensely.

We are still at the beginning of a new movement, which is becoming increasingly important as the overall complexity of software stacks increases. For true self-determination in the ever-growing digital realm, we urgently need to build skills and share the gained knowledge freely and in unlimited ways also in the realm of operational knowledge — exactly the way we started with software code almost 40 years ago. Let’s start closing the gap to have open source style collaboration not just for the Dev piece in DevOps. And this is just another urgently needed piece to enhance and grow the overall digital capabilities for achieving sovereignty in the digital realm.

## We build a community of practice
From time to time, we can get mentally stuck and may need a sparring partner to think outside the box. Open Operations builds a community of practice to keep the barrier to entry low and create a thriving environment for comfortable exchange. Regardless of individual knowledge level, everyone contributes and enriches this community with their knowledge and individual views. Communities of practice connect through various channels serving both asynchronous and synchronous communication needs in the form of pair operating or on a larger scale to solve these challenges together. Therefore, we are building a network by encouraging organizations to foster and connect internal and external communities of practice.

## We share knowledge
[...]

## We believe that failures make us experts
We firmly believe that failures make us experts. The way we handle mistakes is how we become better. We think, that handling mistakes in an optimal way means to communicate about them openly and without shame. We are convinced that the culture we build around failures is fundamental for an innovative environment: Not being afraid of making mistakes opens the door to trying new things, without having the fear to fail. We encourage people to raise their voice - not only in case of success, but also in case of failure. We are sure, that this is one of the best ways to prevent others from making the same mistakes we did.

## We're transparent about our incidents
[...]

## We're transparent about our operational processes
We share our internal processes for the sake of transparency. We firmly believe that transparency leads to better and more reliable processes. We are convinced that publishing well-documented operational processes offers a great opportunity to gather feedback and inspiration from the wide public. 
 
Likewise, we are convinced that us sharing our operational experiences can be of inspiration and benefit for others. In today's business environment, most companies are facing the same challenges. By sharing knowledge the same way the open source community shares software, a common knowledge base can become a reality, allowing everybody to benefit. 
 
We aim to get away from being a big black box and become a source of shared knowledge. We consider the disclosure of internal processes as an essential step towards this direction.
