We – [the founding and supporting organizations](#supporting-organizations) – proclaim transparency, sharing knowledge and are building a community of practice - open operations.

Open Source technology has become increasingly mature. However, the greatest software is useless if it cannot be operated confidently. For this to happen, skills and knowledge must be built up, fostered, and retained. In an increasingly competitive market for skilled people and increasingly complex IT systems, this is becoming an ever-greater challenge for governments, institutions, and companies. How can we operate digital offerings in a self-determined, secure and qualitatively excellent manner?

The answer to this must be the collectivization of operational knowledge, just as it is being practiced for many years with software code. This manifesto provides the foundational principles and invites organizations to join this movement.

## [We](#supporting-organizations) build a community of practice

From time to time, we can get mentally stuck and may need a sparring partner to think outside the box. Open Operations builds a community of practice to keep the barrier to entry low and create a thriving environment for comfortable exchange. Regardless of individual knowledge level, everyone contributes and enriches this community with their knowledge and individual views. Communities of practice connect through various channels serving both asynchronous and synchronous communication needs in the form of pair operating or on a larger scale to solve these challenges together. Therefore, we are building a network by encouraging organizations to foster and connect internal and external communities of practice.

## [We](#supporting-organizations) share knowledge

The availability of knowledge and skilled engineers is the limiting factor for many organizations to adopt, leverage, and successfully operate complex technology. For true self-determination in the ever-growing digital domain, we need to build skills and share the gained knowledge freely and in unlimited ways also in the realm of operational knowledge — exactly the way we started with software code almost half a decade ago. We encourage organizations to collectivize operational knowledge and share it with the entire Open Operations community.

## [We](#supporting-organizations) are transparent about our incidents

We firmly believe that failures make us experts. The way we handle mistakes is how we become better. We think that handling mistakes in an optimal way means to communicate about them openly and without shame. We are convinced that the culture we build around failures is fundamental for an innovative environment: Not being afraid of making mistakes opens the door to trying new things, without having the fear to fail. We encourage people to raise their voice - not only in case of success, but also in case of failure. We are sure that this is one of the best ways to prevent ourselves and others from making the same mistakes. To achieve the state of complete transparency, the history of failures and incidents should be recorded and preserved. Our goal is that others can truly experience trust in this way, rather than just being told they can.

## [We](#supporting-organizations) are transparent about our operational processes

We share our internal processes for the sake of transparency. We firmly believe that transparency leads to better and more reliable processes. We are convinced that publishing well-documented operational processes offers a great opportunity to gather feedback and inspiration from the wider public.

Likewise, we are convinced that us sharing our operational experiences can be of inspiration and benefit for others. In today's business environment, most companies are facing the same challenges. By sharing knowledge the same way the open source community shares software, a common knowledge base can become a reality, allowing everybody to benefit.

We aim to get away from being a big black box and become a source of shared knowledge. We consider the disclosure of internal processes as an essential step towards this direction.

## About this manifesto

The Open Operations Manifesto is initiated by the [Sovereign Cloud Stack Community](https://scs.community) to foster transparency, share knowledge and build a community of practice within the domain of IT operations. It invites organizations to adhere to these priniciples and to take an important step ahead.

We encourage you to join our [mailing list](https://scs.sovereignit.de/mailman3/postorius/lists/list.openoperations.org/) and attend our regular meetings. If you want to contribute to our manifesto or spread the word by signing it, please read through the [README](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/open-operations-manifesto/#readme) or reach out to us at <info@openoperations.org>.
